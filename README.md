# University of Lincoln Advance Programming Assessment Year 2, 2021 - 2022
 This was my final assessment for my CompSci Advance Programming module
 I recived a mark of 59/100 for this module, just on the border of a 2:1
 This was my first time using cpp along with my second ever OOP project
 I found the idea of pointers very hard to understand and get use to
 I was able to create the base functionality for the required project, however I believe I would be able to slightly improve my use of OOP principles if I had slighty more time to work on this assignment.
